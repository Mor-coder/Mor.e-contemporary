             The journey with MacMaris and mo2ma started on a sunny day of years ago now, with an aperol spritz. I was, and still am, fascinated by the relationship between art and technology, and how the latter can enhance the experience of the former. MacMaris and mo2ma do exactly that. MacMaris is an artistic duo, or duet, working with photography, music, and technology in the form of QR code. The process starts with the photography. The image is taken, and sometimes distorted according to the photographer's taste. Then, inspired by the image and its manipulations, the music is composed. It's a duet between the two artists. Last but not least, the viewer is called to play an active part in the appreciation of the work as the music can only be activated by the viewer scanning the QR code inserted on the bottom right of the photograph. <br/>
             Mo2ma, is the same collective working under the same premises, with the addition of a third person. A skilled painter who adds colors and depth to the original photographs.

              I worked with Jennifer Morrison at the STARTnet Art Fair organised by the Saatchi Gallery when the UK was going in and out lockdowns. It many ways, I was very lucky I had the chance to work with her. Jennifer's works vary in scale, with some VERY BIG oils on canvas to smaller one. Either way, the process behind her works it's both physically and mentally demanding having to wait for the oil to dry everytime she applies a new brushstroke. In a way, although her abstract works are very gestural, the wait between paintbrushes make it so that any new addition is well calibrated as opposed to completely, fully instinctive. Working with her and get the chance to listen to her talking about her source of inspiration and working process was well inspiring. She's not only an accomplished artist but a very sensitive and strong soul.
