          Knowning David, and being one of his supporter for quite some time, it
          felt only natural asking him to produce his exhibition in London. When
          we first start talking, which involved a lot of him taking me through
          his mental trips, little we knew that from this very abstract and
          convoluted conversations something BIG would have come out. Indeed, in
          the mist of our chats about painting practice, ethics and morals of an
          artist, the art market, and more practical things, we decided to
          approach the Hungarian Cultural Center and present them the exhibition
          idea. AND THAT WAS IT FOR WHAT FELT LIKE YEARS. Then, one cloudy day,
          we received the email that the Cultural Center couldn't sponsor the
          exhibition, however, the Embassy was interested in hosting and
          sponsoring it! From there, all the chats turned into action until it
          was all done and ready for the grand opening.
