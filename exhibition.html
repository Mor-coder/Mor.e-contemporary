              Knowning David, and being one of his supporter for quite some
              time, it felt only natural asking him to produce his exhibition in
              London. When we first start talking, which involved a lot of him
              taking me through his mental trips, little we knew that from this
              very abstract and convoluted conversations something BIG would
              have come out. Indeed, in the mist of our chats about painting
              practice, ethics and morals of an artist, the art market, and more
              practical things, we decided to approach the Hungarian Cultural
              Center and present them the exhibition idea. AND THAT WAS IT FOR
              WHAT FELT LIKE YEARS. Then, one cloudy day, we received the email
              that the Cultural Center couldn't sponsor the exhibition, however,
              the Embassy was interested in hosting and sponsoring it! From
              there, all the chats turned into action until it was all done and
              ready for the grand opening.
